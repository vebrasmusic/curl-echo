	Use:   "curl-echo echo [-r route] [-n nickname] [-g groupToEcho]",
	Short: "Run API routes and save their responses to files.",
	Long: `The "curl-echo echo" command runs API routes defined in the "apis.json" file and echoes their responses to files.

Usage:
- By default (no flags), it will run all routes in "apis.json" and save their responses.
- With the "-r route" flag, it will only run the specific route matching the provided route string.
- With the "-n nickname" flag, it will only run the route identified by the specified nickname.
- With the "-g groupToEcho" flag, it will run all routes associated with the specified group.
- You cannot chain these, ie. only use one of the flags or it will throw an error.

Examples:
1. Run all routes and save their responses:
   curl-echo echo

2. Run a specific route by its path:
   curl-echo echo -r "/api/v1/resource"

3. Run a specific route by its nickname:
   curl-echo echo -n "getResource"

4. Run all routes in a group:
   curl-echo echo -g "admin"`,

		// if more than 1 is defined, throw error

		// close and save, or if error then skip that one and write to echo.log. if it works, just write "route: xxx successfully echoed."
